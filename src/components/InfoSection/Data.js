    description: 'Smart, trainable, and of noble bearing, the Cane Corso is a peerless protector. At nearly 28 inches at the shoulder and often weighing more than 100 pounds, Corsi are at a glance intimidating creatures. Their imposing appearance is their first line of defense against intruders. Corsi are intelligent and intensely loyal to their humans, but are also assertive and willful, and can end up owning an unwitting owner. As with any other big guardian dog, responsible breeding and early socialization with people and other dogs is vital.'
